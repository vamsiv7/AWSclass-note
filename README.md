Github Introduction::
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: :: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.

git commands::
git commands::

---git clone

git clone https://github.com/srinfotech7358/AWSDevOps.git

git status

git add --all

git commit -m "added some text files to Readmefile"

git push

if we get any Access denied issues during push the changes from local to remote repository,please be authenticate below commands

git config --global user.name "srinfotech7358"

git config --global user.email "srinfotechbatch1@gmail.com"

Github branching strategy::
Untitled
image

A GitHub branching strategy is crucial for maintaining an organized workflow in version control. There are different strategies depending on the size of the project, the number of team members, and the desired workflow. Here are some common branching strategies used in GitHub:

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically. main or master branch always stable and live code

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD feature/2025.03.17

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle. always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.03.17

hotfix branch:: always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

bugfix:: this branch is created from release branch to fix the LLE(lower level environemnt)/Pre-Prod/UAT/Non-Prod issues and once LLE issues fixed ,we should pushed their changes to release branch only.

Execute the Jobs in Parallel::
1.By Default execute the Jenkins build jobs are sequence way,one by one

2.Donât do 2 projects build parallel this is real time scenario but we can do parallel builds as well one job

Jenkins build parallel setup

Go job ---> configure ----> Generall ---> Execute concurrent builds if necessary

Execute concurrent builds if necessary::
When this option is checked, multiple builds of this project may be executed in parallel. By default, only a single build of a project is executed at a time â any other requests to start building that project will remain in the build queue until the first build is complete.

image

Here 5 builds execute parallel ,I kept executor is 5 this is same machine

image

Build Periodically::: H/15 * * * * ----this build happened every 5 minutes without commits ,if changes are commit or not but every 5 mints

build happened in Jenkins

Discard old builds::
Jenkins offers two options for determining when builds should be discarded:

Build age: discard builds when they reach a certain age; for example, seven days old. Build count: discard the oldest build when a certain number of builds already exist. These two options can be active at the same time, so you can keep builds for 14 days, but only up to a limit of 50 builds, for example. If either limit is exceeded, then any builds beyond that limit will be discarded.

---all about your workspace folders

Build Triggers::

--whenever code changes --periodic ---script calls

Build steps::

Dev team will tell ,

Post build::

That aim is giving continue feedback to dev team

--send mails --build pass/fail --CI

Manage Jenkins::
1.configure system

--number of executors --E-mail notifications --internall org SMTP

Pipelines Introduction:::

A Jenkins pipeline is a series of automated steps or stages that define the process of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your code. Jenkins, being a popular open-source automation server, uses pipelines to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

There are two types of Jenkins pipelines:

Declarative Pipeline

Scripted Pipeline

Declarative Pipeline:: The declarative pipeline syntax is simpler and more structured. It's the recommended style for most users because it's easy to read and maintain

Create Pipeline Project::
Steps

Click +New Item

image

Enter the Project Name And Click OK

image

At General Section Provide the Description

image

At Definition, We need to select the Pipeline Script

image

Here's an example of a simple declarative pipeline: Syntax

pipeline{

agent any

stages{

Stage ('Clone'){

steps{

// write code } }

Stage ('Build'){ steps{

// write code } // write code

}

Stage ('Test'){

steps{

// write code } // write code

} Stage ('Execute test casea and get the results'){

steps{

// write code } // write code

}

Stage ('Generated Artifact'){

steps{

// write code } // write code

}

Stage ('Deploy'){

steps{

// write code } // write code

}

// write code

}

}

Please try to create one pipeline job in jenkinsfile and execute the below Declarative pipeline example:;

pipeline {

agent any

stages {
    stage('Clone') {
        steps {
            git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/srinfotech7358/spring-petclinic.git'
        }
    }
    
      stage('Build') {
        steps {
           bat 'mvn clean install'
        }
    }
      stage('Test') {
        steps {
           bat 'mvn test'
        }
    }
    
      stage('Generate Junit Test Results') {
        steps {
           junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
    
      stage('Generate Artifacts') {
        steps {
           archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', followSymlinks: false
        }
    }
}
}

Plugins::
Plugins in Jenkins are essential components that extend its core functionality, allowing you to customize Jenkins to meet specific CI/CD needs. Jenkins has a vast plugin ecosystem that supports building, deploying, and automating software projects across various platforms and tools

Install Plugins in Jenkins::
Step-by-Step: Log in to Jenkins as an administrator.

Navigate to Manage Jenkins (usually on the left sidebar).

Click on Manage Plugins.

(Image reference from Jenkins documentation)

Go to the Available tab.

Use the search box to find the plugin you want.

Check the box next to the plugin name.

Click:

Pipeline: Stage View::
Pipeline: Stage View Plugin in Jenkins The Pipeline: Stage View plugin is a visualization tool in Jenkins that allows users to see a graphical view of each stage in a pipeline. It provides a real-time and historical overview of pipeline execution per stage, making it easier to debug, monitor, and analyze performance.

Click the Build Now and we can triggered the pipeline

Success all the stages & Steps

image

Key elements in the declarative pipeline:::
pipeline: This is the top-level structure.

agent: Specifies where the pipeline will run, such as on any available agent, a specific node, or a Docker container.

stages: Defines the different steps or stages in the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).

steps: Commands to be executed in each stage.

23/05/2025::
Scripted Pipeline::
The scripted pipeline offers more flexibility, but it is less structured and can be harder to maintain. It uses Groovy syntax to define the pipeline.

Here's an example of a scripted pipeline:

node { try { stage('Build') { echo 'Building the application...' // Your build commands here }

    stage('Test') {
        echo 'Running tests...'
        // Your test commands here
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
        echo 'Deploying the application...'
        // Your deploy commands here
    }


    Please try to create one new jenkins pipeline job and execute below script for Scripted pipeline examples

    node {
    stage('Clone') {
            git branch: 'master', url: 'https://github.com/parasa7358/onlinebookstore.git'
		}
		
		 stage('Build') {
    
            bat 'mvn package'
    
		}
		stage('Test') {
    
            bat 'mvn test'
    
		}
    }
Key differences in a scripted pipeline:::
node: Represents a Jenkins agent where the pipeline will run.

Pipeline as Code::
Both declarative and scripted pipelines are stored as Jenkinsfiles, which you place in your source code repository. This allows you to version control your pipeline and keep it aligned with your application code.

Declarative pipeline with Jenkinsfile::
pipeline { agent any

stages {
    stage('Clone') {
        steps {
            git branch: 'main', url: 'git@github.com:parasa7358/spring-petclinic.git'
        }
    }
    stage('Build') {
        steps {
            bat 'mvn package'
        }
    }
    
    stage('Test') {
        steps {
            bat 'mvn test'
        }
    }
    stage('Test Results Reports') {
        steps {
            junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
    
    stage('Artifacts') {
        steps {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', followSymlinks: false
        }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        steps {
            echo 'Hello World'
        }
    }
}
}

This pipeline:::

1 Checks out the source code from your Git repository. 2. Builds the project using Maven. 3.Runs unit tests. 4.Deploys the application using a custom script.

Tomcat Web Server: Introduction
Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is primarily used to serve Java applications and is one of the most popular servlet containers in the world.

Tomcat is an essential tool for anyone working with Java web applications. It provides a simple, reliable platform for deploying and managing Java Servlets and JSPs and is widely used in both development and production environments. Its ease of use, combined with powerful features and flexibility, makes it an ideal choice for many developers working on Java-based web applications.

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container that is primarily used to serve Java-based web applications. It implements several Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specifications, such as Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and WebSocket, among others. Tomcat is often used to run Java applications on the web because it's lightweight, easy to configure, and widely supported.

Here are some key points about Tomcat:

Servlet Container: Tomcat is a servlet container, meaning it manages the lifecycle of Java Servlets, which are small Java programs that run on a web server.

JSP Support: Tomcat also supports JavaServer Pages (JSP), a technology that allows for embedding Java code within HTML pages.

Configuration: Itâs highly configurable through XML files, like server.xml for server settings, web.xml for application settings, and others.

Lightweight: Unlike full-fledged application servers like WildFly (formerly JBoss) or GlassFish, Tomcat is primarily a servlet and JSP container, which makes it lighter and easier to deploy for simpler Java web applications.

Performance: Itâs known for good performance in handling static content, making it a popular choice for Java web developers.

Integrate Tomcat Jenkins::
image

Integrating Tomcat with Jenkins is a common use case for automating the deployment of Java-based web applications. Jenkins can be set up to deploy a web application to a Tomcat server whenever a new build is triggered.

Prerequisites:

Apache Tomcat should be installed and running on your server. Jenkins should be installed and running.

Steps to integrate Jenkins with Tomcat:

Install the "Deploy to Container" Plugin in Jenkins: The easiest way to deploy to Tomcat from Jenkins is by using the Deploy to Container plugin. This plugin allows Jenkins to deploy WAR files to a Tomcat server.
Go to your Jenkins dashboard. Click on Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins. In the Available tab, search for Deploy to Container Plugin and install it. Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the plugin.

Configure Tomcat Server in Jenkins: Now you need to tell Jenkins where your Tomcat server is running.
In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System. Scroll down to the Deploy to container section. Click Add Tomcat Server.

Provide the necessary information: Name: Give the Tomcat server a name (Tomcat9). URL: The URL of your Tomcat server (e.g., http://localhost:8080). Username: The username for Tomcat's manager app (usually admin). Password: The password for that username (set in Tomcat's tomcat-users.xml). Save the configuration.

Configure Tomcatâs tomcat-users.xml: Make sure Tomcat is set up to allow Jenkins to deploy the application by editing the tomcat-users.xml file.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763560/401-unauthorized-error-while-logging-in-manager-app-of-tomcat

tomcat-users.xml file::
image

Restart Tomcat to apply the changes.

Create a Jenkins Job to Build and Deploy the Application: Next, you need to create a Jenkins job that will build your web application (e.g., a WAR file) and deploy it to Tomcat.
From the Jenkins dashboard, click New Item.

Select Freestyle Project, give it a name, and click OK.

TomcatServer Integrate With Jenkins

In the job configuration, go to the Build section and configure your build step, such as building a Maven project For Maven, you can use:

mvn clean install

In the Post-build Actions section, add Deploy war/ear to a container.

In the WAR/EAR files field, provide the path to your WAR file (e.g., target/*.war). In the Container field, choose the Tomcat server you configured earlier. Set the Context Path (e.g., TomcatIntegartedWithJenkins), which is the URL path where the application will be accessible on Tomcat. If you want Jenkins to deploy automatically after every successful build, check the option Deploy after every successful build.

please use below project to configured Tomcat integration

27/05/2025::
Polling SCM (Source Code Management) and webhooks are two common methods used for integrating continuous integration (CI) systems or automating tasks based on changes in repositories.

Polling SCM Polling SCM is a method where a system (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.) periodically checks the source code repository for changes. If it detects changes, it triggers the build process or some other automated task.
How it works:

A job is set up to check the SCM (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or hour).

The CI server pulls the repository to see if there are any new commits since the last poll.

If changes are detected, it triggers the CI/CD pipeline to build, test, or deploy the application.

Webhooks Webhooks provide a more efficient method for triggering actions based on changes in the repository. Rather than the CI system polling for changes, the source control platform sends an HTTP POST request (webhook) to the CI system when an event (like a commit or pull request) occurs.

Integrate Jenkins with Tomcat using Declarative Approach::
To integrate Jenkins with Tomcat using the Declarative Pipeline approach, you'll be using Jenkins Pipeline syntax to automate the deployment process to a Tomcat server. This process typically involves building the application, packaging it, and then deploying it to Tomcat.

Jenkinsfile Configuration (Declarative Pipeline)
In your Jenkins project, you'll create a Jenkinsfile, which contains the Declarative Pipeline syntax. This file defines the steps involved in the CI/CD pipeline.

Please execute below script in jenkins pipeline job using Declarative style

pipeline { agent any

tools{

    maven 'maven'
}

CI/CD::
Continuous Integration & Continutes Deployment & COntinuoues Delivery::
Continuous Integration(CI)::the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple Developers into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository,after which automated builds and tests are run automatically.

developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system such as Git,A continuous integration automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to immediately using jenkins Orchestration.

Continuous Deployment(CD) :: Continuous Deployment is an extension of continuous delivery. With continuous deployment, every change that passes through the automated tests and builds is automatically deployed to production without any human intervention. The deployment process is fully automated.

Continuous Delivery (CD)::Continuous Delivery is a software development practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production in a consistent and reliable manner. The key distinction of continuous delivery is that the process of deploying the code to production is done manually by a human decision-maker.

Ansible Playbooks Introduction::
Ansible playbooks are the heart of automation with Ansible. They are simple YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) files that define automation tasks in a structured, human-readable format. Playbooks allow you to automate configurations, deployments, and orchestration tasks in a clear and organized way.

image

Key Concepts::
Playbook: A playbook is a file that contains one or more "plays." Each play defines a set of tasks to be executed on a group of hosts. The playbook can be used for things like installing packages, managing users, configuring services, etc.

Task: A task is an individual unit of work. Tasks define specific actions, such as installing a package, starting a service, or copying a file. Tasks are executed sequentially, in the order in which they are written in the playbook.

Inventory: An inventory is a list of hosts that Ansible will manage. The inventory file defines which machines to target. An inventory can group hosts together (e.g., web servers, db servers) for easy management.

Modules: Ansible provides numerous modules that are responsible for performing specific tasks like managing packages, services, files, etc. Common modules include apt, yum, service, copy, and file.

Create 3 AWS ubuntu machines::
ACS --ansible control server 2.node1 3.node2
Steps to configure ACS::
passwordauthentication enabled
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Create New user-->ansible and user should be provide the sudo permissions
visudo

ansible ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Please enabled Inbound and Outbound rules::
Inbound and outbound rules refer to the types of network traffic that are allowed or denied to and from a system, such as a server, virtual machine, or network device. These rules are typically defined in firewalls or security groups (such as in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud). The primary goal is to control which data can enter or leave a network, ensuring security and proper access control.

Hereâs a detailed explanation of inbound and outbound rules:

Inbound Rules:: Inbound rules control traffic entering a system or network. These rules define which types of external traffic are allowed to reach a server, instance, or device.

Common Uses: Allowing specific users or services to access the system.

Restricting access to the system from unauthorized users.

Opening ports for services like web servers (HTTP, HTTPS), SSH, database connections, etc

Allowing incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) so that users can access a web server.

Outbound Rules:: Outbound rules control traffic leaving a system or network. These rules define which traffic is allowed to exit a server or device and reach external destinations.

Common Uses: Allowing a server to access external services like APIs, databases, or external servers.

Restricting unwanted traffic from the system to external destinations.

Controlling the flow of outgoing traffic to ensure compliance with security policies.

Allow HTTP/HTTPS: Allow outbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to any IP:

I want categories into Inventory groups::
In Ansible, inventory groups are used to organize and categorize hosts (machines or servers) into logical groups. This allows you to apply tasks to specific sets of servers, simplifying playbook management and execution. An inventory is a list of managed hosts and their associated metadata, and groups are one of the key components of that structure.

Hereâs a detailed explanation of Ansible inventory groups

What Are Inventory Groups? An inventory group in Ansible is a way to group hosts based on a shared characteristic. For example, you might have groups for different environments (e.g., dev, prod), different types of servers (e.g., web_servers, db_servers), or other logical categories that fit your needs.
static inventory groups defined in the standard INI or YAML format.

Define groups of hosts:: >sudo vi hosts
[web_servers]

ansiblenode1@172.31.20.135

ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200

localhost

[db_servers]

How do i write a loops In Ansible::
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_loops.html

Repeated tasks can be written as standard loops over a simple list of strings. You can define the list directly in the task.

Using loops Examples::

name: Add several users ansible.builtin.user: name: "{{ item }}" state: present groups: "wheel" loop:
testuser1
testuser2
ansible loops

Setup module in ansible::
Setup module is used to collect the facts

Facts-----> information gather from nodes called facts

ansible -I hosts -m setup Webserver

image

Using filter command::
If you're asking about the "filter" parameter in Ansible's command-line modules like below

ansible -i hosts -m setup -a "filter=os" Webserver

ansible_os_family": "Debian"

Ansible when statements

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#the-when-statement

ansible_os_family": "Debian"

When condition is always used bottom of the script and using scrips we can able to run a playbook on a different platforms

1.Debian 2.Redhat
hosts: Webserver

become: yes

tasks:

name: install apache

apt: name: apache2

when: ansible_os_family == "Redhat"

In Ansible, variables are used to store values that can be referenced and used throughout your playbooks, roles, and tasks. This allows for dynamic, reusable, and flexible automation. Hereâs a basic breakdown of how Ansible variables work and the different ways you can define and use them:

define variables in 3 places

Inventory level ï lowest priority
Playbook level
Command line level âhighest level priority
defined variable in Ansible::

1.commandline level ---highest priorty 2.playbook level ----2nd highest priority 3.inventory level -- low priorty a.host level variabel b. group level

Inventory variables: These are defined in the inventory file (or dynamic inventory) for specific hosts or groups.

[webservers] ansiblenode1@172.31.20.135 package_name=git ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200 package_name=apache2 localhost

[webservers:vars] ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200 localhost

package_name=httpd

Playbook variables: You can define variables directly within your playbooks using the vars section.

hosts: Webservers

become: yes

vars:

pacakge_name: git

tasks:

name: Install all packages

apt:

name: "{{ pacakge_name }}"

state: present

Command-line variables: You can pass variables to your playbooks at runtime using the -e or --extra-vars option.

ansible-playbook -i hosts -e "package_name=apache2" variables2.yml

Ansible resolves variable values based on a specific precedence order. The order from highest to lowest precedence is:
Extra-vars (-e on the command line): Command-line variables take the highest precedence.

Playbook variables: Variables defined within the playbook.

Inventory variables: Variables set in the inventory.

Working Script::
hosts: Websevers

become: yes

vars:

package_name: apache2

package_httpd: httpd

git_variable: git

tasks:

Registry Module::
Registry is a module used to results can be stored in a variable Stored ouptput of a task or script I want execute a command and results can be stored in a variable is called registry

Handlers::
Sometimes you want a task to run only when a change is made on a machine. For example, you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service, but not if the configuration is unchanged. Ansible uses handlers to address this use case. Handlers are tasks that only run when notified

hosts: webservers become: yes tasks: - name: Ensure apache is at the latest version ansible.builtin.yum: name: httpd state: latest handlers: - name: Restart apache ansible.builtin.service: name: httpd state: restarted

Ansible Roles::
image

Ansible roles are a way of organizing playbooks and tasks in a modular, reusable, and maintainable structure. They allow you to break down complex playbooks into smaller, focused units of functionality that can be easily shared and reused across different projects. Here's a more detailed look at Ansible roles:

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html

1.Written ansible in a reusable fashion 2.How do I use someone elseâs work 3.Ansible galaxy is a place where we can find reusable roles

https://galaxy.ansible.com/

4.Which we can use in your script

install roles

Ansible-galaxy install

ansible-galaxy install my_role

create my own role::

ansible-galaxy init

ansible-galaxy init my_role

Structure of Ansible Roles::
my_role/ âââ defaults/ â âââ main.yml # Default variables âââ files/ â âââ somefile # Files to be copied to the target âââ handlers/ â âââ main.yml # Handlers (usually for service restarts) âââ meta/ â âââ main.yml # Metadata about the role âââ tasks/ â âââ main.yml # The main tasks (this file includes other task files if needed) âââ templates/ â âââ config.j2 # Jinja2 templates for dynamic file creation âââ tests/ â âââ test.yml # Test playbooks to verify the role works âââ vars/ â âââ main.yml # Custom variables

Using Roles in Playbooks Once you've defined a role, you can use it in your playbook like this:

name: Example Playbook using roles hosts: all become: yes roles:
my_role
Benefits of Using Roles Reusability: Roles can be reused across different playbooks and projects.

Modularity: Roles allow you to organize your playbook into smaller, manageable parts.

Clarity: Each role focuses on a specific task or function, making your playbooks more understandable.

Example Role: Installing Tomcat

https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/robertdebock/tomcat/install/

Create my own role

Ansible-galaxy init rolename

Install tomcat

If you're looking to install or use an Ansible role for Tomcat from Ansible Galaxy, you can search for available roles and collections related to Tomcat. Here's how you can find and use a role related to Tomcat from Galaxy.

Search for a Tomcat Role
https://galaxy.ansible.com/

To search for a role related to Tomcat on Ansible Galaxy, you can use the following command: bash Copy ansible-galaxy search tomcat This will return a list of roles related to Tomcat that you can install and use. 2. Install a Tomcat Role Once youâve found a suitable role for Tomcat, you can install it using the ansible-galaxy install command. For example, if you find a role called geerlingguy.tomcat, you can install it by running: bash Copy

ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.tomcat This will download and install the role into your ~/.ansible/roles/ directory (or the path defined in your ansible.cfg file).

Use the Installed Tomcat Role in Your Playbook After installing the role, you can use it in your playbook. Hereâs an example of a simple playbook that installs and configures Tomcat: yaml Copy
Deploywar.yml::
hosts: localhost become: yes roles:

robertdebock.java
robertdebock.tomcat
ansible-playbook -i hosts Deploywar.yml

image

This will use the geerlingguy.tomcat role to set up Tomcat on your webservers hosts.

https://galaxy.ansible.com/robertdebock/tomcat

image

Deploywar.yml

image

Docker Introductions::
Docker is an opensource & Applicatuions level virtualization technology and it's called containirazition.

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in lightweight, portable containers. Containers are isolated environments that package an application and all its dependencies (such as libraries, binaries, and configurations) to ensure it runs uniformly across different computing environments.

image

Docker is a platform and that make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable units that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

container ::
1.container is an insolation area of executuions of your applications OR instance of images are called containers 2.Containers are created from âimagesâ 3. Containers are the core of Docker. They are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments where applications run. Docker is run your software packages /Applications in containers called containarizations.

if you build a docker container for your application called containerization
containers have itâs own boundaries
who will create containers? Ans --docker images are created the containers

Docker Images:
docker image is a package with all dependencies and the necessary information to create the container and docker image derived from multiple base images.

An image is a snapshot of a container, a blueprint that defines what the container will contain and how it will behave when run. It consists of an application and its dependencies. Docker images are built using a Dockerfile

Docker Registry::
A Docker Registry is a system for storing and distributing Docker images. It is a centralized location where Docker images can be uploaded (pushed), stored, and downloaded (pulled) by users and applications. Docker images are the building blocks of containers, and registries provide a way to manage, version, and share these images across different environments.

Default registry :: https://hub.docker.com/

Physical & Virtual & Hypervisors/VMwares::
1.tomcat & nodejs containers have itâs own process tree,own files systems,own network interfaces own storage,ramâ¦etc 2.when you want to give application to your team/testers docker is the best choice and when you want give system to your team/ testers VMwares are best choice. 3.application level virtulization docker is the best choice and OS level virtulization VMwares are best choice 4.individually scale the your application very easy in docker

image

Example:: For festival season In your organization leave management application multiple employees are applied leaves at the same time in that scenario docker is very easy to scale the one more application but physically itâs very difficult so docker is the best choice

Docker High Level Client -Server Architecture::
image

Docker's high-level architecture revolves around several components that work together to provide containerization and isolation for applications

Docker Client (CLI)::
The Docker Client is the primary interface for interacting with Docker. It can be a command-line interface (CLI), like the docker command, or a graphical interface (GUI) in some tools.

It allows users to interact with Docker's features, such as building containers, running containers, and managing containers and images.

It sends requests to the Docker Daemon to execute commands.

Docker Daemon (Dockerd)::
The Docker Daemon (also known as dockerd) is the core component of Docker. It runs in the background on the host system.

The daemon is responsible for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests and handles container lifecycle operations such as starting, stopping, and building containers.

The Docker Daemon can communicate with multiple Docker clients, allowing for distributed management of containers.

Flow:
1.The Docker Client sends a command to the Docker Daemon.

2.The Docker Daemon interacts with containers, images, and storage volumes.

3.The Docker Daemon can pull images from a Docker Registry.

4.The Docker Daemon runs containers based on the images and handles networking and storage.

Docker commands::
docker pull

docker pull hello-world

docker images ----used to display the all images

docker image ls ----used to display the all images

docker run ---used to build the images and create the container

Create the Jenkins container::
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 5000:5000 jenkins/jenkins:jdk21

http://35.155.150.89:8080/

image

docker ps

above command is used to verify the how many containers are running

Create the Nginx web based application container::
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx:latest

http://35.155.150.89/

image

docker ps

above command is used to verify the how many containers are running, you can seee nginx container is running state

detached mode::
Docker detached mode refers to running a container in the background

docker run -d <image_name>

example::

docker run -d nginx

Where:

-d is the flag for detached mode.

<image_name> is the name of the Docker image you want to run.

docker run -d nginx

This command will:

Run the nginx container in detached mode.

Start the container in the background.

To view the containers running in detached mode, you can use the docker ps command:
docker ps

Stopping a Container::
docker stop

Start a Container::
docker start

To run a command inside a running container:
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> docker exec -it 5336d949f33b /bin/bash

root@5336d949f33b:/# hostname 5336d949f33b root@5336d949f33b:/# hostname -i 172.17.0.3

image

NOTE:::
docker exec -it 5178eb58223a /bin/bash Use this command inside the container

ctrl pq Outside the containers

Key Components of a Dockerfile:
FROM: Specifies the base image for the Docker image you're creating.

FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN: Executes commands inside the container, often used to install dependencies.

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3

COPY or ADD: Copies files from your local machine into the container.

COPY . /app

WORKDIR: Sets the working directory for any subsequent commands in the Dockerfile.

WORKDIR /app

CMD: Specifies the command to run when a container is started from the image.

CMD ["python3", "app.py"]

EXPOSE: Defines the network ports the container will listen on at runtime.

EXPOSE 8080

ENV: Sets environment variables inside the container. ENV APP_ENV=production CMD & ENTRPOINT can be executed starting of the container

CMD & ENTRYPOINT Different::
--use CMD you can change the value but ENTRYPOINT not possible to change the value at the starting of the container --CMD you can change the argument value --ENTRYPOINT canât change the argument value

CMD ["echo",".jar"] ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "war"]

CMD/ENTRYPOINT ====ï¨should have something which runs till your app is alive

Note::
life time of your container -->time which your cmd/entrypont is alive

Example Dockerfile:::
Hereâs a simple Dockerfile example that builds a Python web app:

Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

Install the required dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Building and Running a Docker Image: Once youâve written your Dockerfile, you can build and run it using Docker commands:

Build the Docker image:

docker build -t my-python-app .

Run the container:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-python-app

A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It defines the environment and application setup, including dependencies, configurations, and the necessary steps to get your application running in a container. Essentially, it's the blueprint for creating Docker images.

Network Types in Docker:
â¢ bridge: Default network for containers on the same host. â¢ host: The container shares the hostâs networking stack. â¢ overlay: Used for multi-host networking (requires Docker Swarm). â¢ none: No network connectivity is assigned to the container. â¢ >bridge network is used for single node communication â¢ >overlay network is used for multi node communication â¢ ---Kubernetes/swarm are used to communicate 2 containers in docker thatâs like orchestration macvlan network:: may be used to give containers across different hosts unique, routable IP addresses in a larger network IPVLAN:Containers share the hostâs MAC address but have individual IP addresses.

create my own network ::
docker network create my_custom_network

image

Created my own network -ï  my_custom_network image

Run Containers on the Custom Network::
docker run -d --name container1 --network my_custom_network nginx

image

docker run -d --name container2 --network my_custom_network redis

image

In this example: â¢ container1 will run an Nginx container. â¢ container2 will run a Redis container.

Both containers are connected to the my_custom_network.

Inspect the Network::
To view detailed information about a network (like connected containers and settings), use the docker network inspect command:

docker ps docker network ls docker network inspect my_custom_network

image

Connect a Container to a Network:
docker network connect my_custom_network container_name Disconnect a Container from a Network: docker network disconnect my_custom_network container_name Remove a Docker Network:: docker network rm my_custom_network Note that the network must be unused by any containers before it can be removed.

A common use case for Docker networks is to isolate different applications or microservices, ensuring that containers in one application cannot easily communicate with containers in another. This helps you maintain security and control over how containers interact with each other.

USE CASE::
--default network bridge can only ping throw ip address not container name --our own network bridge(mybridge) able to ping both ip address and container name thatâs advantage of network create.

---Kubernetes/swarm are used to communicate 2 containers in docker thatâs like orchestration --if you create your own bridge network the advantage is you can able to resolved the any issues using container name not only ipaddress but by default using you can able to resolved the issues by ipaddress.

bridge network is used for single node communication overlay network is used for multi node communication

Docker Swarm::
Docker and Docker Swarm are both tools used to manage containers, but they serve different purposes and have different features.

image

Docker::
Docker is a platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and ensure that the application works the same regardless of where it's deployed, making Docker a powerful tool for developing, testing, and deploying applications.

Key Features of Docker:
â¢ Containerization: Docker encapsulates applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across environments (e.g., development, staging, production). â¢ Images and Containers: Docker uses images to define the environment for an application. Containers are instances of those images. â¢ Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry where you can find pre-built images or upload your own. â¢ Portability: Docker containers can run on any system with Docker installed, from your laptop to a cloud server. â¢ Isolation: Containers are isolated from the host system, so they donât interfere with other processes or systems.

Common Docker Commands:
â¢ Build an Image: docker build -t my-image . â¢ Run a Container: docker run -d --name my-container my-image â¢ List Containers: docker ps â¢ Stop a Container: docker stop my-container â¢ Remove a Container: docker rm my-container â¢ List Images: docker images

Docker Swarm::
Docker Swarm is a clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers. It allows you to deploy and manage multiple containers across multiple Docker hosts (machines), forming a swarm. This means that you can treat a collection of Docker hosts as a single virtual host and manage them as one. Docker Swarm makes it easier to scale, deploy, and maintain containerized applications in production environments. It provides high availability, fault tolerance, and easy scaling of applications across multiple machines.

Docker SWARM Overview::
this is Docker Inc's Container Orchestration Platform
it only supports managing Docker containerized application workloads
it is pretty easy to install and learn
can be installed on a laptop with pretty basic configuation as well as it is very light weight
good for POC or learning purpose
not production grade
Key Concepts in Docker Swarm:
â¢ Node: A machine (physical or virtual) running Docker that is part of the Swarm cluster. There are two types of nodes: o Manager Node: Manages the cluster and orchestrates services. o Worker Node: Runs the actual containers based on instructions from manager nodes. â¢ Service: A service is a description of the tasks (containers) you want to run. When you define a service, Docker Swarm ensures that the desired number of replicas of that service are running at all times. â¢ Task: A task is a running container in the context of a service. Each task runs a container that is part of a service.

Docker vs Docker Swarm::
â¢ Docker is used to build and run containers on a single machine, whereas Docker Swarm extends Docker to manage containers across a cluster of machines. â¢ Docker Swarm provides orchestration features such as load balancing, scaling, and high availability, which are not available in basic Docker. â¢ Docker Swarm is built into Docker, making it easier to set up and use compared to other container orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

I have created 3 ubuntu machines::

once initialize the swarm it will automatically created overlay network

image

create our own overlay network ::
docker network create âd overlay qt-overlay

image

docker network create -d overlay qt-overlay docker node ls

image

image

create service under the overlay network::
docker service create --name my-web-service --replicas 3 -p 80:80 nginx docker service ls docker node ls

--docker always maintain --replicas 3 means 3 containers by default if for example 1 container die docker automatically create container automatically this is main use of services with docker

docker swarm:: multi containarization for your applications

Docker Swarm is a built-in container orchestration tool that allows you to manage a cluster of Docker hosts as a single entity

in any cloud we have docker /container services lke

Docker Flow

image

Docker compose::
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a docker-compose.yml file, you can configure your applicationâs services, networks, and volumes, and then start them all with a single command. Below, I'll explain how to create a docker-compose.yml file and walk you through an example that demonstrates its use. version: "3" # Specify the version of Docker Compose

services: <service_name>: # Define your services (containers) image: <image_name> # The Docker image to use (can be local or from Docker Hub) build: <path_to_dockerfile> # Path to the Dockerfile if you need to build the image container_name: <container_name> # Optionally define a container name ports: # Map container ports to host ports - "<host_port>:<container_port>" volumes: # Mount volumes (directories or files) - <host_directory>:<container_directory> environment: # Set environment variables - = depends_on: # Define dependencies between services - <another_service> networks: # Specify networks to connect to - <network_name>

networks: <network_name>: # Define custom networks driver: bridge # Optional: can be "bridge", "host", or "none"

volumes: <volume_name>: # Define named volumes for persistent data

Explanation of the docker-compose.yml Example:

Version: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format to use. In this case, 3.8.
Services: o web: This is the service for your Node.js application. ï§ image: Specifies the base image to use (node:18-alpine). ï§ working_dir: Sets the working directory inside the container. ï§ volumes: Mounts the current directory (.) to /app inside the container so your application code is accessible to the container. ï§ ports: Maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 inside the container. ï§ environment: Sets environment variables like NODE_ENV and the database connection information (DB_HOST=db). ï§ depends_on: Ensures the db service is started before the web service. o db: This is the service for your MySQL database. ï§ image: Specifies the MySQL version to use (mysql:8.0). ï§ environment: Sets environment variables such as the MySQL root password, database name, and user credentials. ï§ volumes: Mounts a named volume (db-data) to persist MySQL data between container restarts. ï§ ports: Exposes port 3306 for MySQL to allow communication between containers or with the host.
Volumes: Defines a named volume (db-data) to persist the database data outside of the container.
docker-compose.yml::
version: '3.8'

services: web: image: node:18-alpine # Use the official Node.js image container_name: node-app working_dir: /app volumes: - .:/app # Mount the current directory to /app in the container ports: - "3000:3000" # Expose port 3000 on the host and map it to port 3000 in the container environment: - NODE_ENV=development - DB_HOST=db # Reference the db service as the hostname depends_on: - db # Ensure the db service starts first

db: image: mysql:8.0 # Use the official MySQL image container_name: mysql-db environment: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb MYSQL_USER: user MYSQL_PASSWORD: password volumes: - db-data:/var/lib/mysql # Mount a volume for persistent data ports: - "3306:3306" # Expose port 3306 for MySQL

volumes: db-data: # Define a volume for MySQL data persistence

docker compose up -d

docker exec -it bbeebd8d5ca2 /bin/bash

mysql -u root -p

INSERT INTO SRINFOTECHTABLE VALUES ( 1, "Rawali", "AWSDEVOPSFullStack","Chennai" );

SELECT * FROM SRINFOTECHTABLE;

Use Cases for Docker Compose: â¢ Multi-container applications: Perfect for web applications that rely on more than one service (e.g., database, caching, backend). â¢ Development environments: Provides a consistent environment that can be easily replicated across different machines. â¢ Testing and CI/CD: Can be used to quickly spin up environments for testing or continuous integration/deployment pipelines

Kubernetes Overview::
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google.

image

free and opensource container orchestration platform developed by Google along with many open source contributors

it is production grade

free for personal and commercial use

as it is opensource, we won't get support from Google

only supports command line interface (CLI)

doesn't support web console

Kubernetes does provide some basic Dashboard but it is considered a security vulnerability, hence no one uses the Kubernetes Dashboard

Rancher is opensource webconsole for Google Kubernetes

supports inbuilt monitoring features

it can check the health of our application, when it finds your application is not responding, it can repair it or replace it with another good healthy instance of your application it supports inbuilt load-balancing Master ---Management --(Orchestration) Node machine (minion) --workers (containers)

POD ---the smallest unit, mainatained one or more containers

YAML --key-value paires

1.Container Orchestration: Kubernetes helps you manage multiple containers, ensuring that they run efficiently and reliably across many servers.

2.Scaling: Kubernetes can automatically scale your applications up or down based on demand, making it easier to handle varying workloads.

3.Load Balancing: It can distribute network traffic to different containers, ensuring that applications remain responsive even under heavy loads.

4.Self-Healing: If a container crashes or stops working, Kubernetes can automatically restart or replace it, ensuring the application stays available.

5.Automated Deployment and Rollback: Kubernetes can automate the process of deploying new versions of an application, and if something goes wrong, it can roll back to a previous version.

6.Storage Management: Kubernetes can automatically mount the storage resources you need for your applications, making it easier to manage persistent data.

In short, Kubernetes is designed to make it easier to manage applications at scale in a way that is highly automated, reliable, and efficient. Itâs widely used in DevOps platform

Cluster:: collection of nodes with a single responsibility

All the nodes in that cluster do same process, same type of work can will do collection of nodes in cluster

Cluster:: a cluster might refer to a set of virtual machines or containers working together for a specific application or service.

Kubernetes Cluster Components: 1.Master Node (Control Plane): The Master Node is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster. It manages the cluster and makes decisions about scheduling, scaling, and maintaining the health of the application. The control plane consists of several key components:

1.API Server:: The API server exposes the Kubernetes API, which is used to interact with the cluster.

2.Scheduler:: The scheduler assigns work (pods) to available worker nodes.

3.Controller Manager: : Ensures that the desired state of the system is maintained, such as ensuring that the correct number of pods are running.

4.etcd: A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data, including the state of the system (like deployed pods, config maps, and secrets).

Worker Nodes (Minions): o The Worker Nodes are responsible for running the actual application workloads. These nodes host the pods, which are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A worker node typically runs:

1.Kubelet: An agent that ensures the containers in the pods are running and healthy.

2.Kube Proxy: A network proxy that maintains network rules for pod communication.

3.Container Runtime: The software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

4.Pods::

A pod is the smallest unit of execution in Kubernetes and can contain one or more containers that share resources such as networking and storage. Pods are always deployed in a Kubernetes cluster and are managed by the control plane.

08/07/2025::
Services:
A service in Kubernetes is a way to expose an application running in a pod to other pods or external users. It ensures that network communication between pods is reliable, even as pods are dynamically created or destroyed.

1.Pod is a smallest component in kubernetes

2.In docker smallest component -- > container

3.in kuberneties we will create pods and inside the pods containers are running.

4.one pod speak with other pod using id address(kube-proxy)

5.every pod has ip address

image

Above picture directly using pods without using services and if ipaddress no longer available our application is not worked. pods communication throw ip address right so it has a problem to resolved the this problem services is come to the picture.

With Services::
image

Services âlogical entity and maintain ip address

Basically kubernetes is used for maintain containers

Kubeadm::
bootstraps a cluster. Itâs designed to be a simple way for new users to build clusters (more detail on this is in a later chapter).

Kubectl::
is a tool for interacting with your existing cluster.

Kubelet:
An agent that ensures the containers in the pods are running and check healthy.

kubectl describe svc shopfront

use above command to ge the details of service

in kubernetes we have multiple key components or objects::
YAML::

apiversion --v1 or v2 --standadard syntax kind ----deployment/service metadata ----we can define name of the service name: shopfront labels ---->laben are very important in kubernetes and match with pod and matcgh with service

spec type: clusterIP/NodePort

ClusterIP::
ClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes. It creates a virtual IP (VIP) inside the cluster that other internal components (pods/services) can access â but it's not accessible from outside the cluster.

apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: backend-service spec: type: ClusterIP # This is the default, so it can be omitted selector: app: my-backend ports: - protocol: TCP port: 80 # Port exposed by the service targetPort: 8080 # Port the container is listening on

NodePort:
NodePort is a type of Kubernetes Service that exposes your app outside the cluster, by opening a specific port on each worker node's IP address.

apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: my-nodeport-service spec: type: NodePort selector: app: my-app ports: - port: 80 # Service port (used internally by ClusterIP) targetPort: 8080 # Port on the pod nodePort: 30080 # Optional: if not set, Kubernetes picks one

OpenShift Orchestration::
OpenShift Orchestration::
OpenShift is an open-source container application platform built around Docker containers and Kubernetes. It's designed to help developers and IT organizations to develop, deploy, and manage applications in a highly automated environment. OpenShift offers a range of tools to make the development process more streamlined, such as CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines, a user-friendly web console, monitoring, and logging features. Here are some key features and components of OpenShift:

Kubernetes-based orchestration: OpenShift is built on top of Kubernetes, providing advanced container orchestration, scaling, and management.
Developer Tools: OpenShift offers tools that make it easier for developers to deploy applications, like a simple web-based interface, CLI (Command Line Interface), and built-in support for various programming languages.
Integrated CI/CD Pipelines: OpenShift integrates with Jenkins and other tools to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.
Security: OpenShift has several security features, including integrated authentication, network policies, and role-based access control (RBAC).
Multi-cloud & Hybrid Cloud: It supports hybrid cloud environments, so applications can run across multiple infrastructuresâon-premises, in the cloud, or a combination.
Automated Scaling: OpenShift can automatically scale applications up or down based on resource usage.
Registry and Image Management: It includes a built-in container registry to manage Docker images and store them for your applications
Red Hat Openshift Overview::
Red Hat Openshift is developed on top of Opeensource OKD ( which in turn is developed on top of opensource Kubernetes )
supports command line interface and webconsole(GUI)
supports Role based access control (RBAC), hence multiple users can be created with different level of access to Openshift cluster
supports many additional features on top of all the Kubernetes features
User Management
Pre-integrated monitoring tools ( Prometheus & Grafana Dashboards )
Out of the box - Private Container Registry
Routes - a new feature only available in Openshift which is developed on top of Kubernetes Ingress
Using the Kubernetes operators, the Red Hat Openshift team has many additional features on top of Kubernetes
Openshift version upto 3 - supported many different container runtime/engines including Docker
Openshift version 4 and above - only supports Podman Container Engine and CRI-O Container Runtime
Due to security vulnerabilities issues in Docker,

OpenShift resources â¢ Deployment (K8s resource) â¢ ReplicaSet (K8s resource) â¢ Pod (K8s resource) â¢ Job (K8s resource) â¢ DaemonSet (K8s resource) â¢ StatefulSet (K8s resource) â¢ Build ( OpenShift resource - Custom Resource added by OpenShift ) â¢ ImageStream ( OpenShift resource - Custom Resource added by OpenShift ) â¢ DeploymentConfig ( OpenShift resource - Custom Resource added by OpenShift )

Deployment command looks like this

oc create deployment nginx --image=bitnami/nginx:latest --replicas=3

image

Deployment::
This is a JSON/YAML definition which is stored in etcd database The deployment is managed by Deployment Controller when we applications, they are deployed as Deployment with Kubernetes/OpenShift Deployment Controller creates ReplicaSet, which is then managed by ReplicaSet Controller Deployment has one or more ReplicaSet(s)

ReplicaSet::
This is a JSON/YAML definition which is stored in etcd database The ReplicaSet is managed by ReplicaSet Controller ReplicaSet capture details like How many Pod instances are desired? ReplicaSet Controller reads the ReplicaSet definition and learns the desired Pod instance count ReplicaSet Controller creates so many Pod definition as indicated in the ReplicaSet ReplicaSet Controller ensures the desired Pod count matches with the actual Pod count, whenever a Pod crashes, it is the responsibility of ReplicaSet Controller to ensure the desired and actual Pods are equal ReplicaSet has one or more Pods

Pod::
is a collection of one or more Containers IP address is assigned on the Pod level not on the Container level If two containers are in the same Pod, there will be sharing IP Address of the Pod within container, application are deployment ( tomcat,mysql, nginx these are applications ) recommended best practice,only one application should be there in a Pod Pods are scheduled by Scheduler onto some Node every Pod has a Network Stack and Network Interface Card (NIC)

Kubelet::
is a daemon service that interacts with the Container Runtime on the current node/server where kubelet is running kubelet downloads the required container image and creates the Pod containers kubelet frequently reports the status of Pod container status to the API server kubelet also monitors the health of POds running on the node and ensures they are healthy kubelet will there on every node ( master and worker nodes )

kube-proxy::
is a Pod that runs one instance per node (both master and worker nodes) provides load-balancing a group of similar Pods Sample Demo Project fro Openshift

Kubectl::
is a client tool used to create and manage deployments and services in Kubernetes it also works in OpenShift it make REST call to API Server
